Screenplay

FADE IN:
INT. KOROVA MILKBAR – NIGHT
Tables, chairs made of nude fibreglass figures.
Hypnotic atmosphere.
Alex, Pete, Georgie and Dim, teenagers stoned on their milk-plus,
thier feet resting on faces, crotches, lips of the sculptured
furniture.
ALEX (V.O.)
There was me, that is Alex, and my three
droogs, that is Pete, Georgie and Dim and
we sat in the Korova milkbar trying to
make up our rassoodocks what to do with
the evening. The Korova Milk Bar sold
milkplus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc
or drencrom which is what we were
drinking. This would sharpen you up and
make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-
violence. Our pockets were full of money
so there was no need on that score, but,
as they say, money isn't everything.
INT. PEDESTRIAN UNDERPASS TUNNEL – NIGHT
A Tramp lying in tunnel, singing.
TRAMP
In Dublin's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through streets wide and narrow...
Shadows of the boys approaching fall across Tramp.
TRAMP
Crying cockless and mussels alive,
Alive O...
Alive, alive O... Alive, alive O...
Crying cockless and mussels alive,
Alive O...
ALEX (V.O.)
One thing I could never stand is to see a
filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at
the filthy songs of his fathers and going
blerp, blerp in between as it might be a
filthy old orchestra in his stinking
rotten guts. I could never stand to see
anyone like that, whatever his age might
be, but more especially when he was real
old like this one was.
The boys stop and applaud him.
TRAMP
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me
brothers?
Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
TRAMP
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard
cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not
in a stinking world like this.
ALEX
Oh – and what's so stinking about it?
TRAMP
It's a stinking world because there's no
law and order any more. It's a stinking
world because it lets the young get onto
the old like you done. It's no world for
an old man any more. What sort of a world
is it at all? Men on the moon and men
spinning around the earth and there's not
no attention paid to earthly law and order
no more.
The Tramp starts singing again.
TRAMP
Oh dear land, I fought for thee and
brought you peace and victory.
Alex and gang move in and start beating up on old Tramp.
INT. DERELICT CASINO – NIGHT
Billyboy gang on stage tearing clothes off a screaming Girl.
ALEX (V.O.)
It was around by the derelict casino that
we came across Billyboy and his four
droogs. They were getting ready to perform
a little of the old in-out, in-out on a
weepy young devotchka they had there.
Alex and gang step out of the shadows.
ALEX
Ho, Ho, Ho... Well, if it isn't stinking
Billygoat Billyboy in poison. How are
thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking
chip oil? Come and get one in the yarbles,
if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly
thou.
Billyboy snaps open a switchblade knife.
BILLY BOY
Let's get 'em boys.
The fight begins, chains, knives, kicking boots. Police siren.
ALEX
The Police... come on, let's go... come
on.
Alex and the boys rush out of casino.
EXT. / INT. CAR – NIGHT – FAST DRIVING SHOTS
Swerving car, forcing other cars off the road, trying to hit
pedestrians, etc.
ALEX (V.O.)
The Durango-95 purred away real horrorshow
– a nice, warm vibraty feeling all through
your guttiwuts. Soon it was trees and
dark, my brothers, with real country dark.
We fillied around for a while with other
travelers of the night, playing hogs of
the road. Then we headed west, what we
were after now was the old surprise visit,
that was a real kick and good for laughs
and lashing of the ultra-violent.
EXT. "HOME" – NIGHT
A cottage on its own, on outskirts of a village.
Bright moonlight. Cheery light inside.
Car pulls to stop.
Alex shushes his giggling boys and gets out of the car.
INT. "HOME" – NIGHT
Mr. Alexander typing. Bell rings.
MR. ALEXANDER
Who on earth could that be?
MRS. ALEXANDER
I'll see.
Mrs. Alexander, a good-looking red head in a red jumper suit.
MRS. ALEXANDER
Yes? Who is it?
ALEX
Excuse me, Mrs... will you please help,
there's been a terrible accident.
She opens the door on the chain and peeps out.
ALEX
My friend's lying in the middle of the
road bleeding to death. Could I please use
your telephone for an ambulance?
MRS. ALEXANDER
I'm sorry, but we don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.
ALEX
But Mrs... it's a matter of life and
death.
From inside the sound of clack clacky clack clack clackity
clackclack of Alexander typing stops.
MR. ALEXANDER
Who is it, dear?
MRS. ALEXANDER
There's a young man here. He says there's
been an accident. He wants to use the
telephone.
MR. ALEXANDER
Then you'd better let him in.
MRS. ALEXANDER
Wait a minute.
ALEX
Thank you, Mrs.
Mrs. Alexander opens door, saying...
MRS. ALEXANDER
I'm sorry, we don't usually let people in
in the middle of the night.
Alex and boys have put on their masks and rush into house,
carrying and dragging Mrs. Alexander along with them.
INT. HOME – NIGHT
They go roaring in.
Mr. Alexander is kicked in the face and goes down. Georgie leaps
on him. Pete jumps up and down and the settee. Dim grabs hold of
Mrs. Alexander. Alex whistles piercingly.
ALEX
Right, Pete. Check the rest of the house.
Alex turns to Dim who holds the struggling Mrs. Alexander.
ALEX
Dim...
